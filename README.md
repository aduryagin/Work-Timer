## Description
Every vertical line or section on the progress bar is a 25 minute work session (1 pomodoro). 
The Pomodoro Technique implies that you have to take at least a small 5 minute brake every 25 minutes and at least 15 minute brake every 100 minutes (4 pomodoros).

The app will send you a notification every 25 minutes.
